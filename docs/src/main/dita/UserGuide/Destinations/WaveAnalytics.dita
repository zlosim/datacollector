 <title>Einstein Analytics</title>
 <shortdesc>The Einstein Analytics destination writes data to Salesforce Einstein Analytics. The
        destination connects to Einstein Analytics to create a dataset with external
        data.</shortdesc>

                    destination<index-see>Einstein Analytics destination</index-see></indexterm>When
            you configure the Einstein Analytics destination, you define connection information,
            including the API version that the destination uses to connect to Salesforce Einstein
            Analytics. </p>
        <p>You specify the <i>edgemart alias</i> or name of the dataset to create. The destination
            typically creates multiple datasets for the edgemart alias, based on the dataset wait
            time that you configure for the destination. After no data has arrived for the specified
            wait time, the destination closes and uploads the dataset to Einstein Analytics. When
            new data arrives, the destination creates a new dataset. Each dataset is named with the
            edgemart alias name and appended with the timestamp of when the dataset is uploaded. </p>
        <p>You can optionally configure the destination to use a Einstein Analytics dataflow to
            combine multiple datasets together. You can also specify the metadata of the external
            data in a JSON format.</p>
        <p>You can optionally use an HTTP proxy to connect to Salesforce Einstein Analytics. </p>
