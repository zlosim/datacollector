                    BigQuery</indexterm></indexterm>The Google BigQuery destination streams data
            into Google BigQuery. You can use other destinations to write to <xref
                href="Bigtable.dita#concept_pl5_tmq_tx">Google Bigtable</xref>, <xref
                href="GCS.dita#concept_p4n_jrl_nbb">Google Cloud Storage</xref>, and <xref
                href="PubSubPublisher.dita#concept_qsj_hk1_v1b">Google Pub/Sub</xref>.</p>
        <p>When you configure the destination, you define the existing BigQuery dataset and table to
            stream data into. The destination streams each record into a row in a BigQuery table.
            You can optionally define an expression to specify the insert ID to insert or update.
            The insert ID is a unique ID for each row. If you do not specify an insert ID, the
            destination inserts each record into a new row. </p>
        <p>The destination maps fields from records to BigQuery columns based on matching names and
            compatible data types. You can configure the destination to ignore invalid columns when
            the destination cannot map a field to an existing BigQuery column. You can also
            configure the table cache size for the destination.</p>
        <p>You also define the project and credentials provider to use to connect to Google
            BigQuery. The destination can retrieve credentials from the Google Application Default
            Credentials or from a Google Cloud service account credentials file.</p>
