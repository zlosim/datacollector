    <title>Step 5. Update the Configuration Files</title>
    <taskbody>
        <context>
            <p>A new <ph
                    conref="../Reusable_Content/ReusablePhrases.dita#concept_vhs_5tz_xp/pName-long"

                    conref="../Reusable_Content/ReusablePhrases.dita#concept_vhs_5tz_xp/pName-long"
                /> to start or function properly. In the previous step, you updated the environment
                configuration file so that the new version of <ph
                    conref="../Reusable_Content/ReusablePhrases.dita#concept_vhs_5tz_xp/pName-long"
                /> uses the new configuration files stored in the <codeph>$SDC_CONF</codeph>
                directory. In this step, youâ€™ll compare the previous and new versions of the
                configuration files, and update the new files as needed with the same customized
                property values.</p>
            <p>For example when upgrading from version 2.7.0.0, you'd compare the files in your back
                up directory, /etc/sdc2700, with the files in the /etc/sdc directory. Then update
                the new files in the /etc/sdc directory with any customizations made in the previous
                files in the /etc/sdc2700 directory.</p>
