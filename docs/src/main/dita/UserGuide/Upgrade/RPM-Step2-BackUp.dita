    <title>Step 2. Back Up the Previous Version</title>
    <conbody>
        <p>Before you install the new version, create a backup of the files in the previous version
            by copying and renaming the data and resource directories. Youâ€™ll also need to create a
            backup of the environment configuration file,
                <codeph>$SDC_DIST/libexec/sdcd-env.sh</codeph>, so that the file is not overwritten
            when you install the new version. That way, you can continue to run the previous version
            if needed. </p>
        <p>Copy and rename the following directories and files:<ul id="ul_grw_zch_1z">
                <li>Data directory defined in the SDC_DATA environment variable. Default is
                        <codeph>/var/lib/sdc</codeph>.</li>
                <li>Resource directory defined in the SDC_RESOURCES environment variable. Default is
                        <codeph>/var/lib/sdc-resources</codeph>.</li>
                <li>Environment configuration file used by your operating system:<ul
                        id="ul_z4r_t5w_5bb">
                        <li>For <ph
                                conref="../Reusable_Content/ReusablePhrases.dita#concept_vhs_5tz_xp/ph_LinuxEL6_RPM"
                            />, open the <codeph>$SDC_DIST/libexec/sdcd-env.sh</codeph> file.</li>
                        <li>For <ph
                                conref="../Reusable_Content/ReusablePhrases.dita#concept_vhs_5tz_xp/ph_LinuxEL7_RPM"
                            />, open the <codeph>$SDC_DIST/libexec/sdc-env.sh</codeph> file.</li>
                    </ul></li>
            </ul></p>
        <p>For example, if you are upgrading version 2.7.0.0, copy the Data Collector data directory
            and rename it as follows: <codeph>/var/lib/sdc2700</codeph>. Create a backup of the
            environment configuration file by renaming the file as follows:
                <codeph>sdcd-env-2700.sh</codeph>.</p>
