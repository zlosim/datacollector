 <title>Update MongoDB Destination Upsert Pipelines</title>
 <conbody>
  <p>With version 3.0.0.0, the MongoDB destination supports the replace and update operation codes,
            and no longer supports the upsert operation code. You can use a new Upsert flag in
            conjunction with Replace and Update. </p>
        <p>After upgrading to this release, update the pipeline as needed to ensure that records
            passed to the destination do not use the upsert operation code (sdc.operation.type = 4).
            Records that use the upsert operation code will be sent to error. </p>
        <p>In previous releases, records flagged for upsert were treated in the MongoDB system as
            Replace operations with the Upsert flag set. </p>
        <p>If you want to replicate the upsert behavior from earlier releases, perform the following
                steps:<ol id="ol_hll_bkl_wbb">
                <li>Configure the pipeline to use the Replace operation code. <p>Make sure that the
                        sdc.operation.type is set to 7 for Replace instead of 4 for Upsert.</p></li>
                <li>In the MongoDB destination, enable the new Upsert property.</li>
            </ol></p>
