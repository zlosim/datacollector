 <title>General Validation Errors</title>

  <p><indexterm>troubleshooting<indexterm>general validation errors</indexterm></indexterm>Use the
            following tips for help with general pipeline validation errors:<dl>
                <dlentry>
                    <dt>The pipeline has the following set of validation errors for a stage:</dt>
                    <dd>
                        <codeblock>CONTAINER_0901 - Could not find stage definition for &lt;stage library name>:&lt;stage name>.
CREATION_006 - Stage definition not found. Library &lt;stage library name>. Stage &lt;stage name>. 
Version &lt;version>
VALIDATION_0006 - Stage definition does not exist, library &lt;stage library name>, 
name &lt;stage name>, version &lt;version></codeblock>
                    </dd>
                    <dd>The pipeline uses a stage that is not installed on the <ph
                            conref="../Reusable_Content/ReusablePhrases.dita#concept_vhs_5tz_xp/pName-long"
                        />. This might happen if you imported a pipeline from a different version of
                        the <ph
                            conref="../Reusable_Content/ReusablePhrases.dita#concept_vhs_5tz_xp/pName-long"
                        /> and the current <ph

                        /> is not enabled to use the stage. </dd>
                    <dd>If the <ph
                            conref="../Reusable_Content/ReusablePhrases.dita#concept_vhs_5tz_xp/pName-long"
                        /> uses a different version of the stage, you might delete the invalid
                        version and replace it with a local valid version. For example, if the
                        pipeline uses an older version of the Hadoop FS destination, you might
                        replace it with a version used by this <ph

                    <dd>If you need to use a stage that is not installed on the <ph
                            conref="../Reusable_Content/ReusablePhrases.dita#concept_vhs_5tz_xp/pName-long"
                        />, install the related stage library. <ph
