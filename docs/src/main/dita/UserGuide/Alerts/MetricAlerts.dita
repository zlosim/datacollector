        product="SDC">When <ph
          conref="../Reusable_Content/ReusablePhrases.dita#concept_vhs_5tz_xp/pName-long"/> runs a
        pipeline, the UI displays the pipeline in Monitor mode and displays real-time statistics
        about the pipeline. </ph>You can define and enable metric rules so that you are sent an
      alert when a statistic reaches a certain threshold. </p>
    <p product="SDC">For example, the Record Count and Record Throughput statistics in Monitor mode
      display the number of input, output, and error records that the pipeline has processed:</p>
    <p product="SDC"><image href="../Graphics/MetricStatistics.png" id="image_h55_gc1_qv" scale="50"
      /></p>
    <p product="SDC">You can view the number of error records in these statistics. However, you
      might want to be notified when the number of error records reaches a certain threshold. You
      can enable the default rule for the Pipeline Error Records Counter metric to send an alert
      when the pipeline encounters more than 100 error records. When you enable the metric rule and
      the alert triggers, the alert displays in the <ph
        conref="../Reusable_Content/ReusablePhrases.dita#concept_vhs_5tz_xp/pName-long"/> UI as
      follows: </p>
    <p product="SDC"><image href="../Graphics/MetricAlert.png" scale="40" id="image_ukv_rf1_qv"
      /></p>
    <p>When you enable a metric rule, it automatically enables an alert for the rule. You can also
      configure a metric rule to send email alerts to all email addresses associated with the
      pipeline. </p>
    <p>You configure metric rules when you configure <ph product="SDC">or monitor </ph>the pipeline.
        <ph conref="../Reusable_Content/ReusablePhrases.dita#concept_vhs_5tz_xp/pName-long"/>
      provides a set of default metric rules that you can edit and enable for any pipeline. Metric
      rules take effect after you enable them.</p>
    <p>You can also create custom metric rules. When you create a custom metric rule, you select the
      metric type. The metric type determines which statistic triggers the alert. You configure the
      condition that triggers the alert, and enter the text to display in the alert.</p>
