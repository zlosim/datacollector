 <title>Including Sender Attributes</title>
 <conbody>
  <p><indexterm>Amazon SQS Consumer origin<indexterm>including sender
                attributes</indexterm></indexterm>In addition to SQS message attributes, you can
            include sender attributes in record headers. Sender attributes are custom attributes
            included in messages by the message sender. </p>
        <p>To include message sender attributes, you perform the following steps: <ol
                id="ol_w12_khk_vbb">
                <li>Set the SQS Message Attribute Level property to All Attributes.</li>
                <li>Configure the SQS Sender Attribute property, adding the name of each attribute
                    that you want to include in the record.   </li>
            </ol></p>
        <p>SQS attributes are added to record header attributes using the following naming
            convention: <codeph>sqs.messageAttr.&lt;sender attribute name></codeph>. </p>
        <p>For example, a <codeph>senderId</codeph> attribute appears in the record header as
                <codeph>sqs.messageAttr.senderId</codeph>.</p>
