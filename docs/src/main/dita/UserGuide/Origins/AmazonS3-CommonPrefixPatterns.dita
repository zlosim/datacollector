 <title>Common Prefix, Prefix Pattern, and Wildcards</title>
 <conbody>
        <p><indexterm>Amazon S3 origin<indexterm>common prefix and prefix
                pattern</indexterm></indexterm>The Amazon S3 origin appends the common prefix to the
            prefix pattern to define the objects that the origin processes. You can specify an exact
            prefix pattern or you can use Ant-style path patterns to read multiple objects
            recursively.</p>
        <p>Ant-style path patterns can include the following wildcards: <ul id="ul_lg1_gyd_wv">
                <li>Question mark (?) to match a single character</li>
                <li>Asterisk (*) to match zero or more characters</li>
                <li>Double asterisks (**) to match zero or more directories</li>
            </ul></p>
        <p>For example, to process all log files in <codeph>US/East/MD/</codeph> and all nested
            prefixes, you can use the following common prefix and prefix
            pattern:<codeblock>Common Prefix: US/East/MD/
Prefix Pattern: **/*.log</codeblock></p>
        <p>If the unnamed nested prefixes that you want to include appear earlier in the hierarchy,
            such as <codeph> US/**/weblogs/</codeph>, you can include the nested prefixes in the
            prefix pattern or define the entire hierarchy in the prefix pattern, as
            follows:<codeblock>Common Prefix: US/
Prefix Pattern: **/weblogs/*.log

Common Prefix: 
Prefix Pattern: US/**/weblogs/*.log</codeblock></p>
 </conbody>
