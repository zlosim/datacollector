 <title>Buffer Limit and Error Handling</title>
 <shortdesc>The Directory origin passes each record to a buffer. The size of the buffer determines
    the maximum size of the record that can be processed. Decrease the buffer limit when memory on
    the <ph conref="../Reusable_Content/ReusablePhrases.dita#concept_vhs_5tz_xp/pName-long"/>
    machine is limited. Increase the buffer limit to process larger records when memory is
    available. </shortdesc>

        handling</indexterm></indexterm><indexterm>buffer limit and error handling<indexterm>for
          Directory</indexterm></indexterm>When a record is larger than the specified limit,
      Directory processes the source file based on the stage error handling:<dl>
        <dlentry>
          <dt>Discard</dt>
          <dd>Directory discards the record and all remaining records in the file, and then
            continues processing the next file.</dd>
        </dlentry>
        <dlentry>
          <dt>Send to Error </dt>
          <dd>With a buffer limit error, Directory cannot send the record to the pipeline for error
            handling because it is unable to fully process the record. <p>Instead, Directory creates
              a message stating that a buffer overrun error occurred. The message includes the file
              and offset where the buffer overrun error occurred. The information displays in the
              pipeline history<ph product="SDC"> and displays as an alert when you monitor the
                pipeline</ph>. </p><p>If an error directory is configured for the stage, Directory
              moves the file to the error directory and continues processing the next file.

        </dlentry>
        <dlentry>
          <dt>Stop Pipeline</dt>
          <dd>Directory stops the pipeline and creates a message stating that a buffer overrun error
            occurred. The message includes the file and offset where the buffer overrun error
            occurred. The information displays <ph product="SDC">as an alert and </ph>in the
            pipeline history. </dd>
