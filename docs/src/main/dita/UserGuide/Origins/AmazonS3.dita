                    origin<indexterm>overview</indexterm></indexterm>The Amazon S3 origin reads
            objects stored in Amazon S3. The object names must share a prefix pattern and should be
            fully written. To read messages from Amazon SQS, use the <xref
                href="AmazonSQS.dita#concept_xsh_knm_5bb">Amazon SQS Consumer origin</xref>.</p>
        <p>With the Amazon S3 origin, you define the region, bucket, prefix pattern, optional common
            prefix, and read order. These properties determine the objects that the origin
            processes. You can optionally include Amazon S3 object metadata in the record as record
            header attributes. </p>
  <p>After processing an object or upon encountering errors, the origin can keep, archive, or delete
            the object. When archiving, the origin can copy or move the object. </p>
  <p>When the pipeline stops, the Amazon S3 origin notes where it stops reading. When the pipeline
            starts again, the origin continues processing from where it stopped by default. You can
            reset the origin to process all requested objects. </p>
        <p>You can configure the origin to decrypt data stored on Amazon S3 with server-side
            encryption and customer-provided encryption keys. You can optionally use a proxy to
            connect to Amazon S3.</p>
