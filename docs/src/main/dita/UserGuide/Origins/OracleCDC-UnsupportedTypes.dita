 <title>Unsupported Data Types</title>
 <conbody>
  <p><indexterm>Oracle CDC Client origin<indexterm>unsupported data types</indexterm></indexterm>You
            can configure how the origin handles records that contain unsupported data types. The
            origin can perform the following actions: </p>
        <p>
            <ul id="ul_onj_54n_n1b">
                <li>Pass the record to the pipeline without the unsupported data types.</li>
                <li>Pass the record to error without the unsupported data types.</li>
                <li>Discard the record.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>You can configure the origin to include the unsupported data types in the record. When
            you include unsupported types, the origin includes the field names and passes the data
            as unparsed strings. </p>
        <p>The following Oracle data types are not supported by the Oracle CDC Client origin:<ul
                id="ul_mwq_g4n_n1b">
                <li>Array</li>
                <li>Blob</li>
                <li>Clob</li>
                <li>Datalink</li>
                <li>Distinct</li>
                <li>Java Object</li>
                <li>Nclob</li>
                <li>Other</li>
                <li>Ref</li>
                <li>Ref Cursor</li>
                <li>SQLXML</li>
                <li>Struck</li>
                <li>Timestamp with Timezone</li>
                <li>Time with Timezone</li>
            </ul></p>
        <p>The Oracle Raw datatype is treated as a <ph
                conref="../Reusable_Content/ReusablePhrases.dita#concept_vhs_5tz_xp/pName-long"/>
            Byte Array.</p>
