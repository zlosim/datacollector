        <p>As a DevOps or site reliability engineer - the person responsible for ensuring that all
            services and systems are scalable and reliable - you register both authoring and
            execution <ph
                conref="../Reusable_Content/ReusablePhrases.dita#concept_vhs_5tz_xp/pName-long"/>s
            with <ph conref="../Reusable_Content/ReusablePhrases.dita#concept_vhs_5tz_xp/DPM-short"
            />. You register <ph
                conref="../Reusable_Content/ReusablePhrases.dita#concept_vhs_5tz_xp/pName-long"/>s
            by manually administering them or by automatically provisioning them on a container
            orchestration framework such as Kubernetes. All registered <ph
                conref="../Reusable_Content/ReusablePhrases.dita#concept_vhs_5tz_xp/pName-long"/>s -
            either manually administered or automatically provisioned - function in the same
            way.</p>
        <p>You create <ph
                conref="../Reusable_Content/ReusablePhrases.dita#concept_vhs_5tz_xp/DPM-short"/>
            jobs to run pipelines on groups of execution <ph
                conref="../Reusable_Content/ReusablePhrases.dita#concept_vhs_5tz_xp/pName-long"/>s.
            When you start a job on a group of <ph
                conref="../Reusable_Content/ReusablePhrases.dita#concept_vhs_5tz_xp/pName-long"/>s,
                <ph conref="../Reusable_Content/ReusablePhrases.dita#concept_vhs_5tz_xp/DPM-short"/>
            remotely runs the pipeline on the <ph
                conref="../Reusable_Content/ReusablePhrases.dita#concept_vhs_5tz_xp/pName-long"/>s
            in the group. This enables you to manage and orchestrate large scale dataflows run
            across multiple <ph
                conref="../Reusable_Content/ReusablePhrases.dita#concept_vhs_5tz_xp/pName-long"
            />s.</p>
        <p>You might organize jobs by project, geographic region, or department. For example, your
            data engineer has developed and published the WebLog Collection pipeline and the EDW
            Replication Flows pipeline. In your data center, you designate <ph
                conref="../Reusable_Content/ReusablePhrases.dita#concept_vhs_5tz_xp/pName-long"/>s
            that run on several of the servers as the web server group. You designate another group
            of <ph conref="../Reusable_Content/ReusablePhrases.dita#concept_vhs_5tz_xp/pName-long"
            />s running on other servers as the data warehouse group. You then create a job to run
            the WebLog Collection pipeline on the group of web server <ph
                conref="../Reusable_Content/ReusablePhrases.dita#concept_vhs_5tz_xp/pName-long"/>s. </p>
        <p>The following image displays how the WebLog Collection job runs a remote pipeline
            instance on each <ph
                conref="../Reusable_Content/ReusablePhrases.dita#concept_vhs_5tz_xp/pName-long"/> in
            the web server group. The job does not run pipelines on <ph
                conref="../Reusable_Content/ReusablePhrases.dita#concept_vhs_5tz_xp/pName-long"/>s
            in the data warehouse group, which are <ph
                conref="../Reusable_Content/ReusablePhrases.dita#concept_vhs_5tz_xp/pName-long"/>s
            that are reserved for pipelines that read from the enterprise data warehouse.</p>
