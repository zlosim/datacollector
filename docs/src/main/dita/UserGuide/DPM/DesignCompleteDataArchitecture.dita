 <title>Design the Complete Data Architecture</title>
 <conbody>
        <p>As a data architect - the person responsible for defining how data is stored, consumed,
            and managed by different systems - you design the complete flow of data through multiple
            systems. You might architect the high-level design in a design document or diagram.
            Then, you work with your team to develop <ph
                conref="../Reusable_Content/ReusablePhrases.dita#concept_vhs_5tz_xp/pName-long"/>
            pipelines that meet those dataflow needs.<draft-comment author="alisontaylor">text
                copied from same topic in DPM User Guide. Make the same updates in both places.
            </draft-comment></p>
        <p>For example, you need to create a 360-degree view of your customers by collecting all
            customer data captured in your organizationâ€™s social feeds, enterprise data warehouse,
            and website logs. You need to send all of the data to the Hadoop Distributed File System
            (HDFS) for further analysis using tools such as Hive and Impala. You determine that the
            website logs must be written to Kafka as an intermediary system before being streamed to
            HDFS. </p>
        <p>To address this need, you create the following high-level design of the complete data
            flow:</p>
        <p><image href="../Graphics/DPM_DesignArchitecture.png" scale="70" id="image_w1d_k5r_dx"
            /></p>
        <p>Then the rest of your team uses this high-level design to develop the necessary
            pipelines, jobs, and topologies within <ph
                conref="../Reusable_Content/ReusablePhrases.dita#concept_vhs_5tz_xp/pName-long"/>
            and <ph conref="../Reusable_Content/ReusablePhrases.dita#concept_vhs_5tz_xp/DPM-short"
            />.</p>
 </conbody>
