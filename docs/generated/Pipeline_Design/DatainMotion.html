 <h1 class="title topictitle1">Data in Motion</h1>

 
 <div class="body conbody"><p class="shortdesc">Data passes through the pipeline in <dfn class="term">batches</dfn>. This is how it
        works:</p>

  <p class="p">The origin creates a batch as it
   reads data from the origin system or as data arrives from the origin system, noting the offset.
   The offset is the location where the origin stops reading.</p>

  <p class="p">The origin sends the batch when the batch is full or when the batch wait time limit elapses.
   The batch moves through the pipeline from processor to processor until it reaches pipeline
   destinations.</p>

  <p class="p">Destinations write the batch to destination systems, and <span class="ph">Data
                  Collector</span> commits
      the offset internally. Based on the pipeline delivery guarantee, <span class="ph">Data
                  Collector</span> either
      commits the offset as soon as it writes to any destination system or after receiving
      confirmation of the write from all destination systems. </p>

  <p class="p">After the offset commit, the origin stage creates a new batch. </p>

  <p class="p">Note that this describes general pipeline behavior. Behavior can differ based on the specific
      pipeline configuration. For example, for the Kafka Consumer, the offset is stored in Kafka or
      ZooKeeper. And for origin systems that do not store data, such as Omniture and HTTP Client,
      offsets are not stored because they aren't relevant. </p>

    <h2 class="title topictitle2">Single and Multithreaded Pipelines</h2>

    <div class="body conbody">
        <p class="p">The
            information above describes a standard single-threaded pipeline - the origin creates a
            batch and passes it through the pipeline, creating a new batch only after processing the
            previous batch.</p>

        <p class="p">Some origins can generate multiple threads to enable parallel processing in
                <dfn class="term">multithreaded pipelines</dfn>. In a multithreaded pipeline, you configure the
            origin to create the number of threads or amount of concurrency that you want to use.
                <span class="ph">And <span class="ph">Data
                  Collector</span> creates a number of pipeline runners based on the pipeline Max Runners
                        property to perform pipeline processing. <span class="ph" id="concept_njg_4mx_4y__d78090e2106">Each
                              thread connects to the origin system and creates a batch of data, and
                              passes the batch to an available pipeline runner.</span></span></p>

        <p class="p"><span class="ph"> Each pipeline runner processes one batch at a time,
                        just like a pipeline that runs on a single thread. When the flow of data
                        slows, the pipeline runners wait idly until they are needed.</span></p>

        <p class="p">All general references to pipelines in this guide describe single-threaded pipelines, but
            this information generally applies to multithreaded pipelines. For more details specific
            to multithreaded pipelines, see <a class="xref" href="../Multithreaded_Pipelines/MultithreadedPipelines.html#concept_zpp_2xc_py">Multithreaded Pipeline Overview</a>.</p>

 <h2 class="title topictitle2">Delivery Guarantee</h2>

 
 <div class="body conbody"><p class="shortdesc">When you configure a pipeline, you define how you want data to be treated: Do you want
    to prevent the loss of data or the duplication of data?</p>

            stop while processing a batch of data, when it restarts, it reprocesses the batch. This
