For

                    the new credential functions to retrieve the credential values.</dd>

        <p class="p">The Precondition stage property allows you to define conditions that must be met for a

            version 2.4.0.0 is designed for multitenancy and enables you to share and grant
            permissions on pipelines. Permissions determine the access level that users and groups
            have on pipelines.</p>

        <p class="p">In earlier versions of <span class="ph">Data
                  Collector</span>
            without pipeline permissions, pipeline access is determined by roles. For example, any
            user with the Creator role could edit any pipeline. </p>

        <p class="p">In version  2.4.0.0, roles are augmented with pipeline permissions. In addition to having
            the necessary role, users must also have the appropriate permissions to perform pipeline
            tasks. </p>

        <p class="p">For example, to edit a pipeline in 2.4.0.0, a user with the Creator role must also have
            read and write permission on the pipeline. Without write permission, the user cannot
            edit the pipeline. Without read permission, the user cannot see the pipeline at all. It
            does not display in the list of available pipelines. </p>

        <div class="p">
            <div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span> With pipeline permissions enabled, all upgraded pipelines are initially visible
                only to users with the Admin role and the pipeline owner - the user who created the
                pipeline. To enable other users to work with pipelines, have an Admin user configure
