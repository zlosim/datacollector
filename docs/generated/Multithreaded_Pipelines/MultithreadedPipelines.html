                <dfn class="term">multithreaded pipeline</dfn> is a pipeline with an origin that supports
            parallel execution, enabling one pipeline to run in multiple threads. </p>

    <h2 class="title topictitle2">How It Works</h2>

    <div class="body conbody">
        <p class="p">When you
            configure a multithreaded pipeline, you specify the number of threads that the origin
            should use to generate batches of data. You can also configure the maximum number of
                <dfn class="term">pipeline runners</dfn> that <span class="ph">Data
                  Collector</span>
            uses to perform pipeline processing. </p>

        <p class="p"><span class="ph">A pipeline runner is a <dfn class="term">sourceless
                              pipeline instance</dfn> - an instance of the pipeline that includes
                        all of the processors and destinations in the pipeline and represents all
                        pipeline processing after the origin.</span></p>

        <p class="p">Origins perform multithreaded processing based on the origin systems they work with, but
            the following is true for all origins that generate multithreaded pipelines: </p>

        <p class="p">When you start the pipeline, the origin creates a number of threads based on the
            multithreaded property configured in the origin. <span class="ph">And <span class="ph">Data
                  Collector</span> creates a number of pipeline runners based on the pipeline Max Runners
                        property to perform pipeline processing. <span class="ph" id="concept_xl3_ncd_py__d41337e2106">Each
                              thread connects to the origin system and creates a batch of data, and
                              passes the batch to an available pipeline runner.</span></span></p>

        <p class="p"><span class="ph"> Each pipeline runner processes one batch at a time,
                        just like a pipeline that runs on a single thread. When the flow of data
                        slows, the pipeline runners wait idly until they are needed.</span></p>

        <p class="p"><span class="ph">Multithreaded pipelines preserve the order of
                        records within each batch, just like a single-threaded pipeline. But since
                        batches are processed by different pipeline instances, the order that
                        batches are written to destinations is not ensured.</span></p>

        <p class="p">For example, take the following multithreaded pipeline. The HTTP Server origin processes
            HTTP POST requests passed from HTTP clients. When you configure the origin, you specify
            the number of threads to use - in this case, the Max Concurrent Requests property:</p>

        <p class="p"><img class="image" id="concept_xl3_ncd_py__image_mxx_5sd_ry" src="../Graphics/Multithread-HTTPPipeline.png" height="263" width="470" /></p>

        <p class="p">Let's say you configure the pipeline to opt out of the Max Runners property. When you do
            this, <span class="ph">Data
                  Collector</span>
            generates a matching number of pipeline runners for the number of threads.</p>

        <p class="p">With Max Concurrent Requests set to 5, when you start the pipeline the origin creates
            five threads and <span class="ph">Data
                  Collector</span>
            creates five pipeline runners. Upon receiving data, the origin passes a batch to each of
            the pipeline runners for processing.</p>

        <p class="p">Conceptually, the multithreaded pipeline looks like this:</p>

        <p class="p"><img class="image" id="concept_xl3_ncd_py__image_r5x_532_ry" src="../Graphics/Multithread-HTTPThreads.png" height="487" width="585" /></p>

        <p class="p">Each pipeline runner performs the processing associated with the rest of the pipeline.
            After a batch is written to pipeline destinations - in this case, Azure Data Lake Store
            1 and 2 - the pipeline runner becomes available for another batch of data. Each batch is
            processed and written as quickly as possible, independently from batches processed by
            other pipeline runners, so the write-order of the batches can differ from the
            read-order.</p>

        <p class="p">At any given moment, the five pipeline runners can each
                  process a batch, so this multithreaded pipeline processes up to five batches at a
                  time. When incoming data slows, the pipeline runners sit idle, available for use
                  as soon as the data flow increases.</p>

 <h3 class="title topictitle3">Processor Caching</h3>

 <div class="body conbody">
  <p class="p">Since multithreaded pipelines use multiple
            pipeline runners to run multiple sourceless pipeline instances, processor caching in a
            multithreaded pipeline can differ from a pipeline that runs on a single thread.</p>

        <p class="p">Generally, when a processor caches data, each instance of the processor can only cache
            the data that passes through that particular pipeline runner. Be sure to consider this
            behavior when configuring multithreaded pipelines. </p>

        <p class="p">For example, if you configure a lookup processor to create a local cache, each instance
            of the lookup processor creates its own local cache. This should not be a problem since
            the cache is generally used to improve pipeline performance. </p>

        <p class="p">The exception is the Record Deduplicator processor. The Record Deduplicator caches
            records for comparison for up to a specified number of records or amount of time. When
            used in a multithreaded pipeline, the records in the cache are shared across pipeline
            runners. </p>

                    <dd class="dd">In contrast, the HTTP Server origin listens at an HTTP endpoint. When you
                        configure the number of threads to use, you should consider the maximum

                        and the number of available pipeline runners.</dd>

                    <dd class="dd">Note that idle threads consume few resources, so little harm can come from
                        configuring extra.</dd>

                        pipeline property. </dd>

                    <dd class="dd">Pipeline runners consume resources even when idle. So when considering the
                        number of runners to use, you should decide if you want to optimize for
                        performance, resource usage, or both.</dd>

                    <dd class="dd">Pipeline runners process batches created by the origin threads. The speed of
                        processing might differ based on the complexity of the pipeline logic, batch
                        size, etc. </dd>

                    <dd class="dd">So to determine the number of pipeline runners that you want to use, monitor
                        the number of available runners when you run the pipeline. If you find that
                        you have an abundance of available runners, you might reduce the number of
                        runners that you allow. Conversely, if the pipeline runners are generally
                        unavailable, increasing the number of pipeline runners can improve
                        performance. </dd>

        <p class="p">For example, say you have a pipeline with the Kinesis Consumer reading from 4 shards. In
            the origin, you set the number of threads to 4. You also leave the pipeline Max Runners
            property with the default of 0, which creates a matching number of pipeline runners for
            the threads - in this case, 4. After you start the pipeline and let it run for a while,
            you check back and find the following histogram: </p>

        <p class="p">The histogram shows that the mean is 1.4, which means at any time, it's likely that there
            are 1.4 available runners.</p>

        <p class="p">If this is the peak load for the pipeline, this means you can reduce the number of
            pipeline runners used in the pipeline to 3 without sacrificing much performance. If <span class="ph">Data
                  Collector</span>
            resources are needed elsewhere and you don't mind a minor hit to pipeline performance,
            you might reduce the number of pipeline runners to 2. </p>

 <h2 class="title topictitle2">Resource Usage</h2>

 <div class="body conbody">
        <p class="p">Since each pipeline runner performs all
            processing associated with the pipeline after the origin, each thread in a multithreaded
            pipeline requires roughly the same resources as the same pipeline running on a single
            thread. </p>

        <p class="p">When working with multithreaded pipelines, review the resource usage of the pipeline and
            increase the Max Pipeline Memory pipeline property as needed. </p>
